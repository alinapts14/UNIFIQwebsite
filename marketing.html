      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>The message of our campaign is Our unique differentiations are what should unify us. This means our campaign was all about getting this message across, in which we want everyone to feel welcome and putting ourselves on the market to raise brand awareness. To reach this we tried to be very active on Instagram and TikTok. We tried engaging our viewers by asking them to do things (a call to action) in the caption. For example, to share their experiences or to comment on the post. Another promotional activity we did was organizing a giveaway. These attract a lot of attention, because who doesn’t like free stuff. We chose to promote on Instagram and TikTok since pervious research has shown that those are the most used social media platforms (in our target group). We put the goals quite evenly for both platforms, but in the end, we learned getting followers and likes is easier on Instagram, but the reach objectives are reached on TikTok.</p>
      <p>With the knowledge that people don’t like being advertised on social media we knew the goals should be realistic and not too big. Also, since a lot of different concepts already exist, we decided to be modest with our goals. For the reach objectives we chose higher numbers because this means it just has to be seen by people, but we won’t ask them to do anything. Our response objectives are, based on the laziness of people, therefore way more modest. Our affect objective is important, but difficult to measure. We hope by getting our message across and people liking those posts, we made them feel welcomed as well. </p>
	  <p> In total, on our new TikTok's got a total of 36 likes and 771 views. On Instagram, we reached a total of 208 people with our posts and 26 likes. Meaning we reached our reach objectives and also our response objectives. Our objectives were:</p>
	  <p><b>Reach Objectives:</b> We want to have reached 400 people by June 16th, 202. We want to have reached 200 people on Instagram via reels and posts by June 16th, 2022. We want to have reached 200 people on TikTok by June 16th, 2022.</p>
	  <p><b>Affect Objectives:</b> We want our target audience to feel seen and welcome within our brand.</p>
		<p><b>Response Objectives:</b> We want to have 70 people to follow us on Instagram. We want 30 people to like our TikTok's. We want to have 20 comments on our Instagram posts. </p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>We started really motivated to make a campaign for our brand. However, we soon noticed it was difficult to come up with original content. Also making the content look professional wasn’t as easy as we expected. We then started scrolling through already existing content and saving everything we could remake. </p>
      <p>Our plan as stated above in the communication and media plan, was to use hashtags, post regularly, use viral/popular content, and post during times our target group is most likely to be active on the platforms. We also really wanted to get the unique message of our brand across.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>We learned that the hashtags attracted most of our likes on Instagram, on TikTok we couldn’t really see whether the views and likes were attracted because we came on the for you page because of the hashtags we used or we just got lucky in the algorithm. However, because we used the hashtags chances of being seen definitely increased.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The posting regularly is a learning point for sure. It was hard to keep up with the dates we planned to post in the content calendar. Since there are also specific times, the ones that were best, if you forgot it, we thought it would be better to wait until the next day. Also keeping up with making enough content and having enough ideas to post a lot was hard, harder than we at first expected. What we can do differently is setting alarms and making as much content as possible in advance and put it all as a concept ready to post.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It was also a bit of a struggle how to get out message across indirectly. I think we can still learn how to casually be able to show our brand’s message and not literally having to type it out. Figuring out more of a soft sell approach.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the end I think the number of views we got on TikTok was mostly achieved because we did current trends with the corresponding sounds, what I didn’t expect was getting as many views as we did. We got around 300 views per video and also at least 10 likes on some of the TikTok's. This was more than we expected since we didn’t have a real product to show so we were a little nervous it would look fake. On Instagram it was a little harder to reach a bigger audience. We did achieve more followers than on TikTok but on TikTok reaching more people was considerably easier. &nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>On both Instagram and Tiktok we tried to follow trends to get better engagement, but found trouble with followers engaging with the posts, or even gaining new followers. If we were to continue this project, we would focus on more original content that’s visually appealing enough to catch the eyes of individuals instantly. As we focused so much on trends, it was easy for us to fade away in a pool of many content creators making the same type of content. In order to stand out as a small starting brand, it is important for us to create content that’s fitting and original to our brand. Even though our reach and response objectives were reached, it was harder to manage to get a true ‘community’ that is loyal and intrigued enough by our brand to engage.</p>
      <p>For future recommendations we would make more use of the tools that each platform has. For instance, Instagram has stories and paid advertisements. Stories are a great tool to update your followers on missed content, as regular posts can get lost on someone’s feed, especially when they follow many people. Instagram’s paid advertisements are not expensive and are a great tool to bring your content to a specific target group that should definitely be used by a small brand. Additionally, we would broaden the social media platforms. YouTube has ‘shorts’ which are basically short videos in the same way of a Tiktok or Reel on Instagram. This could be used to our advantage as we made a lot of video content.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;If we were to change the process, we would adjust the way we used trends. We focused mainly on using the popular music from these trends, but these were often not fitting or gave a clear message about our brand. If we were to continue following trends, we would make sure to accurately represent our brand while doing so. Additionally, we would put our focus more on Instagram, as it offers more opportunities to see how we’re doing, in terms of statistics. It also gives more options to reach more people in terms of advertisements. Finally, we would work differently with hashtags. We mainly used the most popular hashtags to reach more people, but it would be better for our brand to use specific ones that are still popular, but define our brand better. This would instantly make it more clear in what we stand for to our audience.</p>
