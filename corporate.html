      <h2>Marketing</h2>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
      <p>Our brand message is “there is no room for differentiation in a world where we are all unique but unified”. We want to show that within our brand everyone is welcome and make all our customers feel included. In addition, we want those people to eventually buy our products.</p>
      <p>To do this, we first started posting content on our social media showing our values. After some of these posts, we started promoting our product. As our social media platforms, we chose Instagram and TikTok since multiple interviews with our target audience showed that these are by far the most popular among them. Therefore, our objectives were based on raising awareness for our brand and brand message via these social media platforms. </p>
		<p> By raising awareness by communicating our brand message, we wanted to reach our affect objectives. For the response and reach objectives, we tried to be as realistic as possible. We know that on TikTok, reach objectives are not that hard to achieve, but the response objectives are difficult to achieve. On Instagram, neither is easy. However, gaining likes by using popular hashtags - which was part of our response objectives - worked successfully for us.  

 </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
      <p>We discovered the importance of a content calendar. We expected the inspiration for original content to come to us easier. We started preparing many half-finished concepts, which we eventually did not use, but which did cost us a lot of time. From that, we learned to work out our concepts in more detail before starting to make them right away. In addition to that, we learned that using viral sounds works well to attract a lot of views. It was hard managing to keep up with making our content and posting this. </p>
      <h4 class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
      <p>We executed a quite successful social media campaign. We reached nearly all of our objectives. In the future, we will keep using the content calendar since this is useful and because we discovered that it can be difficult to keep up with the social media posting. Furthermore, it is easy to forget posting, even though we know posting regularly is crucial to grow as a brand. We would definitely aim to post more if we were to continue this campaign. In addition to that, we would add new strategies. We would expand our campaign to Twitter as well and create direct message campaigns like cards</p>
